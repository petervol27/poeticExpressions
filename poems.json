    "poem": "I am your Romeo, you are my Juliet\nA beautiful poem, a sky full of stars, a sea so calm, it makes me charmed\nYou’d think I would not open my heart\nBut that thing is too hard\nFor you my Juliet I would not be so harsh\nEven though you can’t see your beauty\nI hope my writings and passion towards you shall make you happy\nI often dream of you and at night I get to see you\nCan I ever sleep again without you my gem?\nRelax and let me in\nFor I will not bring pain"

    "poem": "I remember evenings alone, they were so empty\nAnd you would never know about them all\nSo pointless…\nDarling hold me now, I am deep in love with your arms\nWherever they touch me\nDarling never forget I’ll carry you around\nSo hopelessly intoxicated by your sound\nSo please hear me out\nWhen I say this is all I ever wanted\nWell look at me now\nSo happy when you’re around"

    "poem": "I wonder if she thinks of me in the evenings, a flower like her, the moon her reflection as beautiful as all the stars combined and well engulfed in a scent which has such a potent effect on me\nI wonder if she can hear me smile when I’m up in bed thinking about my day\nI wonder if she struggles with distance from me\nCuz I do\nAnd I know the purity of her soul and the lust of her hole\nAnd I wonder when will I see you again and touch your face, hold your hand and drive you mad as I always did"
  },
  {
    "poem": "Talking with you makes it so tough to enjoy any other moment in the world\nI help myself to another taste of your face\nAnd would do so everyday\nCuz I love the way you look today\nAnd I enjoy every time you laugh or you breathe\nCuz I love the way you take my breath away\nSo tell me when it’s all okay so I can feel your warmth again\nAnother day another chance to enjoy your words\nAnd they fill me up to write yours"
  },

    "poem": "Isn’t it too late for me to write? It’s 2am and I am lying in my stupid bed, it’s stupid cuz it’s empty without you\nI wish I could lay there naked beside you, I wish I could eat and be inside you\nI wonder everyday when will I take my hand and put it on your neck and squeeze a little bit\nI’d do anything for another taste of my tongue against your face\nAnd I wonder how you are and can you feel the warmth I feel and the hard on that I get every time I get your text"
  },
  {
    "poem": "The sounds you make, that voice of yours\nI love the taste of the mouth of yours\nI hate the way you’re far away from me\nBut I can live with it as long as I can hear that voice of yours\nThe beauty of it all that is yours\nAnd I just want to be yours\nI wonder how much you want me to be yours\nYou sexy ass demon living in my soul\nCan’t ever let you freaking go\nAnd I like that little noise you make when you speak for long"
  },
  {
    "poem": "It’s always in the evening when it’s night\nAnd I want to speak with you, but nighttime is noon for you\nAnd I hope someday, it will all change\nAnd I know one day, everything will be different\nWhen you’ll be in my arms, resting against my chest, I confess it’s tough without you so much\nI want you so bad\nAnd I’ll sing you those songs we love where I can show my voice, to you I’ll make you smile at it all\nI hope you dream about us tonight, and every other night, until all you see are dreams of us"
  },
  {
    "poem": "When you speak of our memories\nI find the inner strength in me to let go of my misery\nBut the sexual anxiety, it takes me\nAnd I hope that you can understand me\nI want you so badly\nI hate that you’re far away\nI want to put my hand on your face\nAnd kiss you so harshly you’ll scream\nAnd put you through all your desires\nI want to see those blue sexy eyes"

    "poem": "My roughness spilling over you\nYour skin rubs mine\nTime moves slower\nYour tongue takes mine\nWe kiss forever every night\nI wish to have your lips\nSurround me everywhere\nAnd let my hands rub it in and pet you\nGentle yet rough as I like to be\nI’ll spread your legs and eat daily"

    "poem": "You thought I’d forget you, mad aren’t you?\nAgain I am to blame and I love it\nYou are so sexy when you give in to your feminine nature\nI want to tie you up to my bed and play with you all night long\nI fucked up too much now I found out how it feels when you say you love me\nAnd now I won’t stop wanting you even more\nYou’re my flower dosed by God with beauty and grace\nAnd I’m just a bee who wants to see on you\nWell I’d rather you’d sit on me but that’s the metaphor here\nI wonder when will you come for me"

  {
    "poem": "I wonder if you look at the moonlight\nCuz I’m staring at it straight\nI hope you feel the warmth coming from me\nThe clouds can’t hide the beauty\nYour light is still more bright\nAnd you’re just so sweet\nThat smile on your face those lips I like\nI want to sleep with you at night\nI can’t dream again\nA year can’t go by faster\nThat’s so lame\nI wonder if you can see the sunlight tomorrow and feel my warmth again"

  {
    "poem": "I know the distance is too long, but I already know you’re pulling me in and you’re under my skin\nI can’t let go can’t push you out\nOutside of my heart and soul\nAnother I won’t love the way I love you through it all\nWonder when will you accept\nThe way I want to be yours\nI wonder how much longer must I hold back\nI go to the sea to see your eyes\nJust sitting in the sand smiling\nI just want to see you again"
  },
  {
    "poem": "I stopped caring about what everyone thought\nThat night\nI didn’t sleep at all just thinking about you you know\nThat night\nYour lips were so sweet their taste I would always need\nAnd tonight\nI am still craving it\nThe colors in my life have all changed\nInto red and pink, like your shirt I loved to lift\nThat leg of yours that I miss on the road\nAnd that smile of yours"

  {
    "poem": "It’s just the way I feel today or maybe it’s a lifetime thing forever and always\nBut I just feel your warmth all around me I cannot stop myself anymore\nI’d steal a plane go insane break the world again just for a moment with you\nAnd you’d think I’d close away run away or ignore you no\nI’ll always want you\nDon’t forget I’m a mess and I don’t mind holding on to you everyday of my life\nJust you and you again and again more and more in my head no escape\nBut I like it\nI enjoy it so much\nI want to touch again feel again that same feeling I get just with you\nCome to me come again"

  {
    "poem": "Oh how hard do you make so fabulous so simple so natural\nLike everything with you seems to flow like a river going upwards it should not be that majestic\nand surreal\nI enjoy the taste of you even if I can’t touch you\nI long for the moment I take you and give you a home\nNear me below you’ll always go\nSomething from behind other times upfront\nBut all in all I’ll bite your butt"

  },
  {
    "poem": "I’d soar into the sky at night singing my songs without fright should it make your heart warm up\njust a tad and give you a good night\nIt’s a double meaning metaphor that plays along this awesome road we pave together\nendlessly and even distance cannot stop\nKaraoke nights I’ll sing my heart out in the light of your eyes as you’re sipping your wine\nsmiling at this magical moment again\nIt’s been so long\nI miss that smile of yours\nI’ll see it everyday and that is not enough\nI hope you smile today"

  },
  {
    "poem": "Through all the storms through all the seasons passing through us as days go by\nAnd one thing I know one thing I long for\nThat is you\nEven if the sails break down\nAnd the waves bury my ship\nEven if the tides pull me apart\nI will return to you\nNo road is too far off\nAnd the weather won’t wear on\nCuz I’m on my way\nTo take you away\nYou’re my destiny and I’m yours"
